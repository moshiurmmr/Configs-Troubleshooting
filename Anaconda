1. Start Anaconda navigator from Linux command prompt
$anaconda-navigator

2. Problem: '$ anaconda-navigator' command won't start the anaconda navigator
  Solution: i. run the command '$conda install anaconda-navigator'
            ii. then run, '$ anaconda-navigator', it should work.
            
3. To check anaconda version, $conda list anaconda

4. To update anaconda
  i. update package manager, $ conda update conda
  ii. update meta package, $ conda update anaconda
  
5. To check Python version in Anaconda, chec platform it is running on, andbase paths for environment and packages
    $ conda info
    
6. Install tensorflow in a conda environment
  i. create a conda environment for installing Tensorflow, let's name the environment 'tensorflow' using Python version 3.6
      $ conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6
  ii. activate the tensorflow conda environment, $ source activate tensorflow
  iii. now in the tensorflow conda environment prompt install tensorflow
      (tensorflow) <user>@<machine_name>:~/<directory>$ pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow # do not use pip3 instad of pip, it creates installation problem
      This will install tensorflow in your anaconda directory, e.g., ~/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow. Normally, it doesn't matter
      in which directory you put the tensorflow installation command, it will be installed in the anaconda envs directory 
      (~/anaconda3/envs/)
 7. Troubleshoot:
  problem: tensorflow runs in python (e.g., '$ python'; '>>>') in virtualenv. But it's unavailable in Jupyter notebook when the
  notebook is run from the virtulenv prompt ('(tflow) moshiur@moshiur-ubuntu:~$').
  Solution: The reason is Jupyter notebook is not installed in the environment. Note that the notebook might be installed in
  the operating system (e.g., Ubuntu/Windows) but as the virtulaenv (tflow here) is separate from the operating system, it
  should be installed in the in virtualenv, '(tflow) moshiur@moshiur-ubuntu:~$ conda install jupyter notebook'. 
  Same is true for any package (e.g., scipy, scikit-learn) that is used in virtualenv.
8. Install scikit-lear, scipy, pandas using conda
  i. conda install scikit-learn
  ii. conda install -c anaconda scipy 
  iii. conda install pandas
